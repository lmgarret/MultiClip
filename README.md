# MultiClip
A python solution to a multiple clipboard.

Originally made for my sister, which had to copy the 5/6 same text (mainly emails) for the whole day at her job; now I may find some use to it too!

##Installation
Download it, launche the MailPasteLauncher.exe and you're basically done! It's written in python, but it's included in a lightened version, so no compatibility/dependencies issue and no extra installation!

##Configuration
Edit the "mailX.txt" (X being a number) file and paste your content in it, save it. Ctrl + X (the number) paste your content where you want. Congrats, you now have 10 clipboards :)

##About
This utility is made using pyHk and pyHook libs/scripts; all based on Windows' Python's 2.7.10 distribution.
